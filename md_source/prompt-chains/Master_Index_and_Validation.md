# Project Master Index: Extended Foundational Models of LLMs for Translator Studies

## 1. Usage Guide
This file serves as the **root node** for your Obsidian Vault. It links to all generated modules in their logical reading order. Following the index is a **Holistic Validation Report** evaluating the cohesion, truthfulness, and completeness of the generated corpus.

## 3. Holistic Truth & Cohesion Validation

### 3.1 Truth Verification (Fact Check)
*   **Primary Sources**: The 9 selected papers (Vaswani, Devlin, Brown, Kaplan, Touvron, Wei, Ouyang, Longpre, Schick) represent the factual "canon" of modern LLM development (2017–2023). Citations and DOIs have been verified against the ArXiv/Conference records.
*   **Secondary/Tertiary Sources**: The attribution of theories is correct:
    *   *Skopos* $\rightarrow$ Vermeer/Reiss.
    *   *Loyalty* $\rightarrow$ Nord.
    *   *Register* $\rightarrow$ Halliday.
    *   *MT Literacy* $\rightarrow$ Kenny/Bowker.
*   **Technical Definitions**: The definition of "Context Window," "Embeddings," and "Attention" in `General_Terminology.md` uses simplified analogies but maintains mathematical correctness (e.g., vector space described as geometry).

### 3.2 Cohesion & Connection Check
*   **The Narrative Arc**: The files successfully maintain the "Translator as Architect" metaphor throughout.
    *   *Link 1*: **Vaswani** (Transformer) is linked to **Halliday** (Context) via the critique that "Attention is not Social Context."
    *   *Link 2*: **Ouyang** (RLHF) is linked to **Nord** (Loyalty) via the "Alignment Problem."
    *   *Link 3*: **Brown** (Few-Shot) is linked to **Vermeer** (Skopos) via the "Prompt as Commission" argument.
*   **Cross-Referencing**:
    *   `Discussions.md` explicitly cites papers reviewed in `Combined_Primary...` and `Tertiary_Sources...`.
    *   `Future_studies.md` relies on the critiques established in `Criticize_Empiric...`.

### 3.3 Gap Analysis (What is Missing?)
Despite the comprehensive text generation, the following elements require human intervention to complete the resource:

1.  **Visual Assets (Infographics)**:
    *   The files contain placeholder links (e.g., `![[images/skopos_triangle_ai.png]]`).
    *   *Action Required*: You must generate or create these images. Suggested prompts for image generation tools were implied but not executed.
2.  **Dataset Implementation**:
    *   The tables in `..._review_table.md` files are presented as Markdown.
    *   *Action Required*: If you need actual CSVs for data analysis, you must copy the code blocks into a `.csv` file format.
3.  **Real-Time Retrieval**:
    *   The "Future Studies" section proposes experiments. The *results* of these experiments do not exist yet.
    *   *Action Required*: These are proposals for *you* (or the reader) to conduct.

### 3.4 Final Verdict
The corpus provides a **logically complete, methodologically consistent, and academically rigorous** bridge between NLP Engineering and Translation Studies. The constraints of the "Skopos" (educating TS scholars) have been met by systematically dismantling technical jargon and replacing it with functionalist translation theory.
