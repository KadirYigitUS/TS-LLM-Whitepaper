# Technical Implementation Plan: Skopos & Prompting
- [x] **Theoretical Mapping**: Define Prompt Engineering not as "hacking" but as the rigorous application of the *Translation Brief* (Commission).
- [x] **Terminology Bridge**: Equate *Skopos* (Purpose) with *System Instruction*, and *Translatum* (Target Text) with *Model Completion*.
- [x] **Practical Demonstration**: Provide a "Before/After" prompt example where applying Skopos theory fixes a hallucination or style error.
- [ ] **Next Step**: Await user confirmation to proceed to the "Context Engineering" file.

# Prompt Engineering as Functional Translation: The Skopos Connection

## 1. Why this matters to Translation Studies
For decades, functionalist translation scholars (Reiss, Vermeer, Nord) have argued that **context and purpose define the translation**, not just the source words.
In the era of LLMs, this is no longer just theory; it is the **operational code** required to make the machine work. An LLM without a prompt is a probabilistic engine without a destination. Prompt Engineering is simply *Skopos Theory applied to Neural Networks*.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation: Vermeer’s Skopos Rule
**Source**: Reiss, K., & Vermeer, H. J. (2013). *Towards a General Theory of Translational Action: Skopos Theory Explained* (C. Nord, Trans.).

### 2.1 The Core Concept
Vermeer posited that the **Skopos** (Greek for "purpose" or "aim") of the target text determines the translation methods.
*   **The Skopos Rule**: "The end justifies the means." If the purpose is to sell a product, a free translation is better than a literal one. If the purpose is legal accuracy, literalism is required.
*   **The Commission (Brief)**: The set of instructions given by the client defining the Skopos.

### 2.2 The AI Equivalent: Conditioning
In Generative AI, the model models the probability $P(w_t | w_{<t})$. It predicts the next word based on context.
*   **The Problem**: If you give *no context*, the model predicts based on the "average" of the internet (its training data).
*   **The Solution**: The Prompt serves as the **Commission**. It constrains the probability space to a specific "Purpose."

## 3. Mapping Theory to Practice

| Skopos Terminology (Vermeer/Nord) | AI/LLM Terminology (OpenAI/Anthropic) | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Commission (Brief)** | **System Prompt / Instruction** | Defines the constraints, role, and goal. |
| **Skopos (Purpose)** | **Goal / Objective Function** | *Why* are we generating this text? (e.g., "to persuade," "to explain"). |
| **Source Text (ST)** | **User Input / Context** | The material to be transformed. |
| **Target Text (Translatum)** | **Completion / Output** | The result generated by the model. |
| **Adequacy** | **Alignment / Faithfulness** | Does the output meet the user's need? |
| **Equivalence** | **Exact Match** | (Rarely used in AI) Does it match the source word-for-word? |

## 4. Operationalizing Skopos: The "Prompt Template"
To get high-quality translation from an LLM, we must treat the prompt as a **Skopos Commission**. A vague prompt ("Translate this") leads to a "Functionally Undefined" output.

### 4.1 The Bad Prompt (Undefined Skopos)
> **User**: "Translate this into English: 'Il pleut des cordes.'"
>
> **AI (Probability Default)**: "It is raining ropes."
>
> *Critique*: The AI defaulted to literalism because no functional constraint was given. It failed to recognize the idiom because the "Purpose" (produce natural English) was not explicit.

### 4.2 The Skopos-Driven Prompt
We construct the prompt using the **Nordian Loop** (Who is it for? Why? How?):

```markdown
# Role (The Translator's Persona)
You are an expert literary translator specializing in French-to-English idioms.

# The Skopos (Purpose)
Your goal is to translate the following phrase for an American novel audience. 
Focus on *functional equivalence* (impact) rather than literal meaning. 
The tone should be colloquial and atmospheric.

# Source Text
"Il pleut des cordes."

# Constraints
- Do not use footnotes.
- Use an English idiom if available.
```

> **AI Output**: "It's raining cats and dogs."
> *(Or even better, depending on context: "It's bucketing down.")*

## 5. Christiane Nord’s "Loyalty" and AI Alignment
**Source**: Nord, C. (1997). *Translating as a Purposeful Activity*.

Nord added the concept of **Loyalty**: The translator must not only serve the client's purpose but also remain loyal to the source author's intent (avoiding deception).

### 5.1 The Alignment Problem
In AI, this mirrors the **Helpfulness vs. Truthfulness** trade-off (Ouyang et al., 2022).
*   **Skopos (Helpfulness)**: The user wants a persuasive text.
*   **Loyalty (Truthfulness)**: The source text contains weak arguments.

### 5.2 Engineering "Loyalty"
If an LLM is asked to translate a medical text "creatively" (High Skopos/Low Loyalty), it might hallucinate dangerous advice. We must Engineer Loyalty into the prompt:

> "Translate this medical insert for a patient.
> **Priority**: Accuracy and Safety (Loyalty) encompass Readability (Skopos).
> Do not simplify medical terms if it loses precision.
> If a term is ambiguous, output [AMBIGUOUS] instead of guessing."

## 6. Visualizing the Skopos Triangle in AI
*Ideally, include a diagram here showing the relationship between Source, Target, and Prompt.*

*(Alt Text: A triangle with vertices 'Source Text', 'Target Audience', and 'AI Model'. The 'Prompt' acts as the gravity pulling the AI toward the Audience.)*

## 7. Summary for the Translator
Prompt Engineering is not a new computer science skill; it is the **formalization of the Translation Brief**.
1.  **Define the Role**: Who is the AI? (Expert Translator).
2.  **Define the Skopos**: What is the text for? (Persuasion, Documentation, Subtitling).
3.  **Define the Addressee**: Who will read it? (Children, Lawyers, General Public).

Without these three definition steps (The Skopos), the LLM is just a statistical parrot. With them, it becomes a functional agent.
