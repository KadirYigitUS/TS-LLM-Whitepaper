# Technical Implementation Plan: Conclusion
- [x] **Narrative Arc**: Trace the trajectory from the "Black Box" of 2017 to the "Glass Box" of 2025 (understood through theory).
- [x] **Thematic Synthesis**: Merge the *Predictability* of Scaling Laws with the *Unpredictability* of Human Culture.
- [x] **Final Verdict**: Declare the new role of the translator not as a "victim" of automation, but as the "architect" of probability.
- [ ] **Next Step**: Await user confirmation to proceed to the "Future Studies" file.

# Conclusion: The Architect of Probability

## 1. The Opening of the Black Box
We began this inquiry with a "Black Box"—the Transformer architecture of Vaswani et al. (2017). For many in Translation Studies, this box was a magical, opaque object that consumed text and excreted translation.
Through the review of nine seminal papers, we have dismantled the box. We found:
*   **Vectors, not Meanings**: Mikolov (2013) showed us that the machine sees geometry, not semantics.
*   **Attention, not Reading**: Vaswani (2017) showed us it processes parallel weights, not sequential grammar.
*   **Statistics, not Knowledge**: Kaplan (2020) and Brown (2020) showed us that what looks like "intelligence" is often just the emergent property of massive scale and power laws.

## 2. The Necessary Collision with Theory
However, engineering alone does not explain translation. It explains *prediction*.
To understand Translation, we had to collide these engineering breakthroughs with the "Tertiary Sources" of Translation Theory:
*   **Prompting is Skopos**: We observe from Reiss & Vermeer (2013) that the "System Instruction" is actually a **Translation Brief**. The machine has no intent; the human must provide the *Skopos*.
*   **RAG is Context**: We learned from Halliday (1978) that the "Context Window" is empty until we fill it with the "Context of Situation" (Field, Tenor, Mode).
*   **Evaluation is Literacy**: We learned from Kenny (2022) and Koehn (2010) that we cannot trust the machine's "confidence" or its BLEU score. We must audit the process.

## 3. The New Reality: The Probabilistic Translator
The era of the "Dictionary Translator" is dead. The era of the **Probabilistic Architect** has begun.
The modern translator does not just "transfer words." They:
1.  **Calibrate the Engine**: Using *Prompt Engineering* to set the Skopos.
2.  **Curate the Knowledge**: Using *Tools and RAG* (Schick et al., 2023) to prevent hallucination.
3.  **Align the Ethics**: Overriding the generic "Safety Filters" of the model to ensure *Loyalty* (Nord, 1997) to the specific text.

## 4. Final Thoughts: Technology as a Mirror
The Large Language Model is a mirror of the internet's average. It reflects the dominant languages, the dominant cultures, and the dominant biases (Bowker, 2023).
If left alone, it will produce the "Average Translation"—grammatically perfect, culturally hollow.
It is the task of the Translation Studies scholar and practitioner to break this mirror—to force the machine to deviate from the average, to recognize the unique, the specific, and the human.
We do not study LLMs to surrender to them. We study them to master them.
