# Conclusion — The Architect of Probability

## 1. Opening the Black Box
- Vectors replace meanings (Mikolov, 2013).
- Attention replaces sequential reading (Vaswani, 2017).
- Scaling + power laws explain apparent "intelligence" (Brown & Kaplan, 2020).

## 2. Collision with Translation Theory
- **Prompting is Skopos**: System instruction = translation brief.
- **RAG is Context**: Halliday’s Field/Tenor/Mode must fill the window.
- **Evaluation requires Literacy**: Kenny & Koehn remind us to audit process, not just scores.

## 3. Probabilistic Translator
Modern translators:
1. Calibrate engines via prompt engineering.
2. Curate knowledge via tools/RAG.
3. Align ethics via loyalty notes.

## 4. Technology as Mirror
LLMs mirror dominant cultures; left unattended they produce hollow, average translations.

> “The machine calculates the probability. The human determines the purpose.”
